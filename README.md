# RoomAcoustiC++: Real-time Acoustics Library - Unity Engine Interface

RoomAcoustiC++ (RAC) is a C++ library for real-time room acoustic modelling designed for psychoacoustic research and immersive audio applications.
RAC was developed as part of a PhD at the University of Surrey and is distributed open-source with the aim of encouraging and increasing accessibility to real-time acoustics across technical and non-technical research fields.
This repository provides modular C# scripts and resources for integrating RAC with the Unity projects.

The official documentation of RoomAcoustiC++, including the Unity Engine interface is available here [https://roomacousticpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://roomacousticpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Aknowledgements
The project utilises the [3D-TuneIn Toolkit](https://github.com/3DTune-In/3dti_AudioToolkit) (3DTI) for binaural processing.
The forked 3dti_AudioToolkit repository (included as a submodule) includes all the required files for use with RAC.
Some small changes have been made for the purposes of compatibility between the source files.

The lock-free queue [concurrentqueue](https://github.com/cameron314/concurrentqueue) is used for multithreaded audio processing.
